# no-NSTK-airdrop-for-undelegating-kuji-
HI! I'm starting this discussion to pay attentions to validators who received millions $NSTK airdropped by UNSTAKE.fi thanks also to undelegated kuji. Will delegators be friendly to chain supporters too? thanks for time spent reading this
This is a question born a few hours ago by a TG group of cosmonauts who starts undelegating to liquid their bonded Kuji, looking for new strategies in defi opportunities like eris or others strider like versions, now with unstake finance. 
This protocol a few hours ago announced the NSTK aidrop, Validators already received, Finder says it. 
Now addresses with pending kuji already received all rewards except the new token.
Hope Validators will be friendly to addresses who contribute this huge airdrop, rewarding them with their shares.
see you in 21 days
thanks to every validator who spent time to read this
